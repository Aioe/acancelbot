Acancelbot is a php script that download USENET messages from innd without using TCP/IP connections and then verifies if they contain some regular 
expressions decided by the user and in case it generates a cancel message. Traditional cancel messages are supported as well as NOCEM cancels.
This script requires INND, an open source news server.

Beware! This code is an alpha release, it is probably bugged. Read the code before trying to use it.
